Strapi Deployment on AWS ECS Fargate_spot using Terraform & GitHub Actions
This project demonstrates deploying a Strapi application on:
Amazon ECS Fargate_spot Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) Amazon ECR Application Load Balancer (ALB) Automated using Terraform + GitHub Actions CI/CD

Step 1: Create Strapi Application
Created a new project folder.

Inside that folder, created a Strapi application:

npx create-strapi-app strapi-app
Configured Strapi to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

Verified locally that Strapi runs successfully.

Step 2: Create Amazon ECR Using Terraform
Wrote Terraform code to create an ECR repository.

Files used:

ecr.tf provider.tf

Ran Terraform commands:

terraform init terraform plan terraform apply

ECR repository was successfully created in AWS.

Step 3: Build, Tag and Push Docker Image to ECR
Created a Dockerfile for Strapi.

Built Docker image:

docker build -t strapi-app .
Tagged the image:

docker tag strapi-app:latest :latest
Logged into ECR:

aws ecr get-login-password --region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin
Pushed image to ECR:

docker push :latest
Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure Using Terraform
Terraform creates:

VPC
Subnets
Internet Gateway
Security Groups
RDS PostgreSQL
ECS Cluster
ECS Task Definition
ECS Service
Application Load Balancer
Commands used:

terraform apply

After deployment:

Verified ECS service is running.
Checked that tasks are healthy and wheather fargate_spot configured or not.
Confirmed RDS is available. -Verified ALB target group is healthy.
Step 5: Configure GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Added workflow file inside:

.github/workflows

ci.yaml
cd.yaml
Workflow performs:

-Build Docker image -Tag image -Push image to ECR -Update ECS service

Added AWS credentials as GitHub Secrets:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

AWS_REGION

Pushed code to GitHub repository. Once pushed:

GitHub Actions automatically triggered.

CI builds Docker image and pushes image to ecr.

CD initialize terrform and terraform apply to revision the task definition.

ECS service updates automatically.

Step 6: Access the Application
After successful deployment:

Go to AWS Console.

Open EC2 → Load Balancers.

Copy the ALB DNS URL.

Example:

http://my-alb-123456.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Open the DNS URL in browser.

Strapi application loads successfully.
